# JWT-Auth-BE
The Back-End of a template JWT Authentication with typeORM | Graphql | Typescript

The purpose is so anyone can use this template and right away start with a Authentication and not worry about it. This repo pairs up with the *FE* https://github.com/MarcoEscaleira/JWT-Auth-FE

# Setup

 1. `yarn install`
 2. `yarn start`

### Then you are ready to  go :) 

  `http://localhost:4000` or to access graphql playground `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
  
  
## Important notes
I based this template on the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25GS0MLT8JU&list=PLV_Gr0x76WLsL8fLmAsOoS4hNkGYcDCbw&index=22&t=0s
<br/><br/>
And like I said before this is based on Ben's video but the most changes this has is on the FE side with redux and a few more implementations.
